Welcome to my Portfolio Project! This website serves as a showcase of my data analytics and visualization projects. Here, you'll find an array of data-driven projects, including COVID-19 analyses, Tableau visualizations, and more. As I continue to learn and grow in the field of data analytics, I'll be adding new projects to this portfolio. Feel free to explore, and I'm open to collaboration and feedback. Let's embark on this data journey together!
